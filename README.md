This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating a common recursion error. The function `my_function` has a flawed base case for recursion, resulting in a `RecursionError`. The `bugSolution.py` file shows how to correct the base case to avoid this error.  The code is simple to understand and shows a typical mistake that happens in recursive functions.
